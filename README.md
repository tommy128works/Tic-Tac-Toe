# Tic-Tac-Toe

Play Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend!

This library page was created as a learning exercise for JavaScript Factory Functions and Module Pattern.

This project had many functions that were organized into objects to minimize global code. It was learned that taking time to plan out the code before starting helped with reducing the confusion and stress of developing this application.

This is a guided project by The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)
